1.)Device a test to guage usability
We need to create a customised test to guage the usability of our designs

2.)Analyse results to understand flaws
next we have to study the results and remedy the flaws as and when we notice them

3.)Reiterate the design
After analysing the flaws, we have to adapt the design to suit the newly found requirement


4.)Remove features/items that are unnecessary
Any of the features that are found to not be required in the bigger scheme of things have to be removed or improved then and there

5.)Implement the newly recognised changes
Next step is to implement these changes to the existing feature set and tools that we decide on keeping

6.)Perform further rounds of user testing
Then we have to perform further round of user testing to fine tune our design

7.)Repeat steps till required level of perfection is obtained
Finally we rinse and repeat our steps until we reach a satisfactory level of detail and quality is reached
