1.)Decide who the the users and participants areBefore creating a framework, we have to decide clearly who it is meant for and the type of clientale that are going to use it

2.)Envision the context
We also need to visualise the context within which our services will be used 

3.)Discover the relationship between the users
Considering this is a multi-user scenario, we have to chalk out the relationship and symbiosis between all segments of users

4.)Decide the set of rules governing the system-user symbiosis
Now that the relationship between the users has been established, we also need a set of rules to act upon to migate issues and decide their aims, goals and paths

5.)Decide the type of interactions between users
After the fourth step, we have to decide the different tools, methods and techniques using which the various users would interact, with the system and amongst themselves

6.)Design all the services and sub-services you will provide aforehand
All the services and their features, different versions, customisability and other aspects have to be decided before getting into the next phase

7.)Map the entire system using all these segments
Finally, we have to map the entire system to understand how all these elements will interact with each other and independently
