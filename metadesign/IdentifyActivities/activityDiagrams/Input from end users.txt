1.)Users and designers decide tasks
In true spirit of the open design process, the users and designers decide the tasks that they have to perform to fit into the whole of the system

2.)User's are asked to perform the tasks
As part of user studies, the user's performance in the tasks that they are to perform, is evaluated while they are on the job

3.)user performance is observed
In a normal environment, the performance of the user is studied and an average is chalked out to see how well they perform in their tasks

4.)Records are created and a through analysis is done
All the results of these studies are recorded and analysed

5.)Similarities in patterns are observed and a loopholes are remedied
Patterns(if any) are recognised amongst the user studies and any deviations are corrected to bring the experience to optimal levels

6.)Using these improvements a prototype is created
Then, we take the results of these studies and use it to tailor a prototype

7.)Steps are repeated until the system is sufficiently refined
The steps from 1-6 are repeated in a loop until we get satisfactory results
