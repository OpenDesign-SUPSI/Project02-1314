The aim of this exercise is to identify the 
manufacturing, distribution and design processes.

Since our project is a community service, which acts as a bridge between senior citizens
and the younger members of society.

It dies this by a mutual exchange of experiences and wisdom from elderly people in return
for companionship and assistance from wider society.

This community service is made of three main phases.The first one is the physical interface 
which can be housed in a building, basement, town hall or other common areas.

The second phase is an online platform which delivers subscription services to connect and 
disseminate information both within and outside the community at large.

Finally, we have the print medium which will be a point of contact between the providers and
the recievers of the service besides acting as promotional material to educate future subscribers.
